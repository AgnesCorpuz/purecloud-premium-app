 https://developer.mypurecloud.com/appfoundry/premium-client-applications.html

 TL;DR: Premium Client Applications are a type of Custom Client Applications that streamline and automate monetization through PureCloud.


## Summary of File and Code Structure

- Local Assets are contained inside the /docs folder. This is also the exact files that are hosted in the GitHub Pages link above.

The docs/index.js script is for testing your own modifications with NodeJS (using Express).
The 'redirectUriBase' values need to be updated from docs/config/config.js before being able to run locally. (ie. https://localhost/)

If you'll be running the sample from a different host, then you'll also need to change the 'clientIds' from the config file to one that you've created(Implicit Grant Type) in your test PureCloud environment. This is for setting the valid redirectUri.
